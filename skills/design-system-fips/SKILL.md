# Design System FIPS

Use this skill whenever the task involves FIPS interfaces or when another AI needs a portable package of the design rules.

## Workflow

1. Read `references/source-of-truth.md`.
2. Load only the reference file needed for the task:
   - `references/foundations.md` for colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows, and global CSS tokens.
   - `references/components.md` for component APIs, variants, imports, and reusable snippets.
   - `references/patterns.md` for screen composition, application shell, hero/header, data listing, modal workflow, and governance.
3. Reuse existing tokens and components before creating anything new.
4. If the requested UI diverges from the system, evolve the design system first and only then consume the new variant.

## Non-negotiables

- Brand identity source of truth is `docs/Brandbook PPT.pdf`. If the PDF is unavailable, follow the exact token tables and snippets in the reference files.
- Headings use `Saira Expanded`. Body copy uses `Open Sans`.
- Product UI stays inside the FIPS palette: deep institutional blue for structure, gold/orange for accents, restrained neutrals for surfaces and borders.
- Use `PageHero` for module headers and `Field` plus `Input`/`Select`/`Textarea` for forms.
- Do not create one-off local overrides for radius, shadow, border, spacing, or color just to satisfy one screen.

## Fast repo lookups

Use these searches when the repository is available:

- `rg -n "PAGE_HERO_DEFAULT_DECORATION|PageHero" src`
- `rg -n "buttonVariants|badgeVariants" src/components/ui`
- `rg -n -- "--color-primary|--color-accent|--shadow-card|--font-heading" src/styles/globals.css`
- `rg -n "DocPage|PatternGuidelines" src/docs`

If the repository is not available, treat the portable references bundled with this skill as the source of truth until the codebase is synced.
